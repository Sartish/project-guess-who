A project inspired by the classic board game Guess Who, now coded into a digital plattform. using JavaScript conditionals, objects and arrays and also connect this to the DOM.

## The build & challanges

âœ… To reate and manipulate objects
âœ…To create and manipulate arrays
âœ…Array methods such as forEach() and filter()
âœ…Manipulating the DOM using Javascript
âœ…Code structured in functions 

CHallange was to to plan and think about game logic. thinking what will happen after each step and the app should react to this. 
Approaching programming object and arrays. Discussion with other developers, stack overflow, google etc. Following a 6 step plan from starting the game to the end. Next step ðŸ‘‰ would be to add more interaction for the user, like player name and more CSS styling.
